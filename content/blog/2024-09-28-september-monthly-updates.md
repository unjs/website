### üåü what is new?



### better stability

Crossws 0.3.x includes an overhaul of refactors, stability improvements, and new features. A new codebase and testing matrix had been implemented ([#55](https://github.com/unjs/crossws/pull/55)) to make sure all supported adapters and runtimes work as expected and are consistent with each other.

### refined peer api

The peer object allows easy interaction with connected WebSocket clients from server route hooks ([peer docs](https://crossws.unjs.io/guide/peer)).
To improve Web standards compatibility, accessing upgrade URL and headers is now possible with `peer.request.url` and `peer.request.headers` (**breaking change**), and `peer.addr` is also renamed to `peer.remoteAddress` to improve readability (**breaking change**) and support is increased across providers. You can also use new lazy-generated and secure `peer.id` (UUID v4) for various purposes including temporary sessions or persistent state.
Two new methods are now supported to close connected peers using `peer.close(code, reason)` and `peer.terminate()`. With this new version, you can access a standard [`WebSocket`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSocket) interface using `peer.websocket`.
> [!NOTE]
> Today many of the server runtimes don't provide a spec-compliant `WebSocket` API. Crossws uses an internal proxy to polyfill consistent access to `extensions`, `protocol`, and `readyState`. See [compatibility table](https://crossws.unjs.io/guide/peer#compatibility) for more details.

### refined message api

On `message` [hook](https://crossws.unjs.io/guide/hooks), you receive a message object containing data from the client ([message docs](https://crossws.unjs.io/guide/message)).
Parsing incoming messages can be tricky across runtimes. Message object now has stable methods `.text()`, `.json()`, `.uint8Array()`, `.arrayBuffer()`, `.blob()` to safely read message as desired format. If you need, you can also access `.rawData`, `.peer`, `.event` (if available), and lazy generated secure  UUID v4 `.id`

### authentication via `upgrade` hook

When you need to authenticate and validate WebSocket clients before they can upgrade, you can now easily use the `upgrade` hook to check incoming URLs and headers/cookies and return a Web Standard [Response](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response) in case you need to abort the upgrade.

### pubsub with deno and cloudflare durable objects

One of the common use cases of WebSockets is pubsub. This release adds pub-sub support to [Deno provider](https://crossws.unjs.io/adapters/deno) and also you can globally broadcast messages using `ws.publish` for advanced use cases.
Normally with cloudflare workers, it is not possible to connect multiple peers with each other. Cloudflare [Durable Objects](https://developers.cloudflare.com/durable-objects/) (available on paid plans) allows building collaborative editing tools, interactive chat, multiplayer games, and applications that need coordination among multiple clients.
Crossws provides a new composable method to easily integrate WebSocket handlers with Durable Objects. Hibernation is supported out of the box to reduce billing costs when connected clients are inactive. ([durable object peer docs](https://crossws.unjs.io/adapters/cloudflare#durable-objects))

## jiti

This month, we release 2 new releases (1 major release, 0 minor release and 1 patch release):

- [v2.0.0](https://github.com/unjs/jiti/releases/tag/v2.0.0)
- [v2.0.0-rc.1](https://github.com/unjs/jiti/releases/tag/v2.0.0-rc.1)

### üåü highlights



### üî•  native esm

jiti v2 now natively supports ESM import and resolution with new API `await jiti.import(id)` and `jiti.esmResolve(id)`. This allows top-level `await` and native+faster importing of ES-only modules with increased compatibility

### ‚öõÔ∏è jsx support

You can now directly import `.jsx`/`.tsx` files with jiti! See examples with [nano-js](https://github.com/unjs/jiti/blob/main/test/fixtures/jsx/nano-jsx.jsx),  [preact](https://github.com/unjs/jiti/blob/main/test/fixtures/jsx/preact.jsx), [React](https://github.com/unjs/jiti/blob/main/test/fixtures/jsx/react.jsx) and [Vue](https://github.com/unjs/jiti/blob/main/test/fixtures/jsx/vue.jsx). This feature is opt-in for now (using `jsx: true` or `JITI_JSX=true`). Jiti is considering a [smarter lib detection](https://github.com/unjs/jiti/issues/302) for wider support before enabling JSX support by default.

### üì¶ dual format package exports

`jiti` package exports are now in a dual (ESM/CJS) format for better importing of jiti in ESM contexts.

### üéà `jiti/native`

As native ESM and Typescript support is being increased across runtimes, a new export in jiti allows easing up the transition by giving the same API of jiti but instead only depending on runtime [`import.meta.resolve`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/import.meta/resolve) and dynamic [`import()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/import) support. This is possible by making an alias for `jiti` to `jiti/native`.

### üöö esm loader

You can globally register jiti using Node.js [global hooks](https://nodejs.org/api/module.html#initialize) (experimental).
CLI:
```bash

### instead of `npx jiti index.ts`

node --import jiti/register index.ts
```
Programmatic:
```js
import "jiti/register";
// or
await import("jiti/register");
```

### üîç better inspection

You can inspect what jiti internals using [`debug`](https://github.com/unjs/jiti#debug) option or `JITI_DEBUG=1` environment variable. The output is now more readable and with colors to easily find slow imports.
jiti will also use `node_modules/.cache/jiti` directory instead of temp dir (if `node_modules` exists) to store caches for easier local inspections.

### ‚¨ÜÔ∏è migration

Upgrade `jiti` dependency to `^2.0.0` in `package.json`
Use new `createJiti` named export :
ESM:
```diff js
--- import createJiti from "jiti"
+++ import { createJiti } from "jiti"
const jiti = createJiti(import.meta.url)
```
CommonJS:
```diff
--- const createJiti = require("jiti")
+++ const { createJiti } = require("jiti")
const jiti = createJiti(__filename)
```
Migrate from CommonJS to ESM API: (**highly recommended!**)
Importing modules:
```diff
--- const mood = jiti('mod')
+++ const mood = await jiti.import('mod')
```
Resolving modules:
```diff
--- const path = jiti.resolve('mod')
+++ const path = jiti.esmResolve('mod')
```

### ‚ù§Ô∏è thank you!

This release wasn't possible without valuable ecosystem feedback and [contributors](https://github.com/unjs/jiti/graphs/contributors).  With the trust of [users](https://github.com/unjs/jiti/tree/v2.0.0?tab=readme-ov-file#-used-in) with astonishing [**60M+** monthly downloads](https://npm.chart.dev/jiti), i hope jiti v2 can help speed up the ecosystem transition to ESM and Typescript.
