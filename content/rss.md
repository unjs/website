RSS ('Really Simple Syndication') feeds allow you to see when websites have added new content. Using this, allow you to get the latest headlines from our blog or articles as soon as they are published, without having to visit the website you have taken the feed from.

You can start using RSS feeds with one of the following:

- Modern web browsers,
- Web-based readers,
- Desktop software.
