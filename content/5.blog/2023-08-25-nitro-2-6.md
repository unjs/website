In this blog post, you can explore the latest updates to [Nitro](https://nitro.unjs.io), a powerful tool for building platform-agnostic server-side and backend applications. [Nitro](https://nitro.unjs.io) powers [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com) and is accessible to everyone!

## üåä Native Response Streaming

Nitro 2.6 includes [h3](https://h3.unjs.io) 1.8 for native [Web Streams](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ReadableStream) and [Response](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response) support. It also includes runtime and type-safe request validation utils, event handlers with an object format, and more!

:another-article{link="/blog/2023-08-15-h3-towards-the-edge-of-the-web"}

Web Streams are now supported for [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en), [Bun](https://bun.sh), [Deno](https://deno.com/), [Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com/), and [Vercel](https://vercel.com). For incompatible platforms, Nitro automatically reads the full stream ([#1624](https://github.com/unjs/nitro/pull/1624)) and converts it to a compatible format. We are closely collaborating with various teams to expand streaming support across all layers.

## üì¶ Runtime-Key Compatible Export Conditions

Nitro 2.6 now automatically adds export conditions based on the [Runtime Keys Proposal](https://runtime-keys.proposal.wintercg.org/) ([#1401](https://github.com/unjs/nitro/pull/1401)).

Using platform export conditions, Nitro can smartly use the appropriate build of your project libraries for each deployment target. Runtime-key compatible conditions have been introduced to the unjs packages, such as [unjs/node-fetch-native](https://node-fetch-native.unjs.io) and [unjs/ofetch](https://ofetch.unjs.io), with the intention of standardizing this approach across more packages.

For advanced use cases, you can override export conditions using the `exportConditions` flag.

## üß© Async Context and Composition API

Nitro 2.6 introduces a new experimental `useEvent()` API, enabling request events to be available in all async contexts without the need for explicitly passing them around to all functions as arguments ([#1546](https://github.com/unjs/nitro/pull/1546)).

This unblocks a new powerful design pattern, making server events accessible in any async context using `useEvent()`. This feature was inspired by the [Vue Composition API](https://vuejs.org/guide/extras/composition-api-faq.html) and is powered by [unjs/unctx](https://unctx.unjs.io).

You can enable this feature by setting `experimental.asyncContext: true`.

**Note:** Currently, this feature is supported for Bun and Node.js environments supporting [`AsyncLocalStorage`](https://nodejs.org/api/async_context.html#class-asynclocalstorage). We intend to increase platform coverage following [`AsyncContext` proposal](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-async-context).

## üöÄ Bundled Runtime Dependencies

When building applications for production, Nitro uses a tool called [vercel/nft](https://github.com/vercel/nft) to trace the files used from the `node_modules` folder and copies them into the `.output/server/node_modules` folder. This method has advantages like working well with the native modules that cannot be bundled with [rollup](https://rollupjs.org/). However, there are also some disadvantages with this method:

- Additional data such as `package.json` files is copied to the output directory.
- Increased startup overhead due to `node_modules` resolution.
- Tracing allows us to optimize tree-shaking output up to the file level, as opposed to per-export tree-shaking.
- Potential issues with wrong export condition resolutions and hoisting when multiple versions are present.

Nitro 2.6 now automatically bundles its own dependencies, such as `h3`, `defu`, `hookable`, `ofetch`, etc. While many of these are small and compact, bundling them results in substantial performance improvements!

Measurement / Mode     | External Deps (2.5) | Bundled Deps (2.6)
----------------|---------------|------------------
Number of Files | 60           | 9
Disk Size | 508K | 292K
Disk Size (gzip) | 100Kb | 72Kb
Start | 34.7ms | 18ms
Fetch | 17.2 ms | 14.6ms
Start to Fetch | 53.2ms | 34.7ms

(Note: Benchmarks conducted on MBA M2 with Node.js v18.16.1. Refer to [#1554](https://github.com/unjs/nitro/pull/1554) for benchmark script details.)

If you require the previous behavior for any reason, you can set the `experimental.bundleRuntimeDependencies: false` configuration.

## ü™ù Error Capturing and Lifecycle Hooks

Nitro 2.6 introduces support for two new APIs: `useNitroApp().captureError()` and `event.captureError()` ([#1463](https://github.com/unjs/nitro/pull/1463)), and it automatically captures lifecycle errors!

You can use a [Nitro plugin](https://nitro.unjs.io/guide/plugins) to hook into both auto-captured and manually captured errors. This enables easy integration with your custom logging infrastructure.

```ts
export default defineNitroPlugin((nitro) => {
  nitro.hooks.hook('error', async (error, { event }) => {
    console.error(`${event.path} Application error:`, error)
  })
})
```

Furthermore, three global hooks have been introduced: `request`, `beforeResponse`, and `afterResponse` ([#1545](https://github.com/unjs/nitro/pull/1545)), allowing for global interception of request lifecycles via Nitro plugins.

```ts
export default defineNitroPlugin((nitroApp) => {
  nitroApp.hooks.hook('request', (event) => {
    console.log('on request', event.path)
  })

  nitroApp.hooks.hook('beforeResponse', (event, { body }) => {
    console.log('on response', event.path, { body })
  })

  nitroApp.hooks.hook('afterResponse', (event, { body }) => {
    console.log('on after response', event.path, { body })
  })
})
```

## üíæ Default Persistent Data Storage

Nitro provides a versatile [Key-Value storage layer](https://nitro.unjs.io/guide/storage) powered by [unjs/unstorage](https://unstorage.unjs.io). The default storage backend is in-memory, and you can configure and combine multiple storage backends for use in both development and production environments.

Nitro includes a standard `cache:` storage, which is internally used for the [cache layer](https://nitro.unjs.io/guide/cache) and [cached route rules](https://nitro.unjs.io/guide/routing#route-rules). The data will be stored in `.nitro/cache` (or `.nuxt/cache`) during development. In Nitro 2.6, a new standard persistent storage, `data:` ([#1352](https://github.com/unjs/nitro/pull/1352)), is introduced. This is available for both development and production modes with Node.js-compatible runtime presets.

 To minimize bundle size, we have created a new compact and production-ready [`fs-lite` driver](https://unstorage.unjs.io/drivers/fs#nodejs-filesystem-lite) in unstorage. Data will be stored in the new `.data/kv` directory within your project and persist across builds. It's ready to use out of the box with `useStorage('data')` and you can always configure the `data:` mount point with your desired backend and use it at runtime!

## üó∫Ô∏è Lighter Source Maps

In Nitro 2.6, the legacy [`source-map-support` polyfill](https://www.npmjs.com/package/source-map-support) has been removed, and an optimization has been introduced to automatically _tree-shake_ sourcemap entries within the `.output/server` directory by removing content maps of libraries from `node_modules`. These changes significantly contribute to reducing the production bundle size.

To leverage native sourcemap support for Node.js, you can set the `NODE_OPTIONS=--enable-source-maps` environment variable. This option will be automatically enabled for the Nuxt and Nitro CLI in upcoming releases.

If you need to disable new optimizations, you can use the `experimental.sourcemapMinify: false` flag.

## üíª Better CLI Experience

The Nitro CLI now supports the `--preset` argument and `--minify`/`--no-minify` arguments for `nitro build` ([#1621](https://github.com/unjs/nitro/pull/1621)).

Latest nitro CLI ships with the latest [unjs/listhen](https://listhen.unjs.io), featuring Cloudflare Quick Tunnels (`--tunnel`) powered by [unjs/untun](https://untun.unjs.io) and QR Support (`--host --qr`) powered by [unjs/uqr](https://uqr.unjs.io).

The development server has been migrated to utilize [unjs/httpxy](https://httpxy.unjs.io), a TypeScript fork of `http-proxy`. This move aims to enhance performance and stability for the future.

## üî• Firebase 2nd Gen Preset

Thanks to extensive community efforts, Nitro now supports Firebase 2nd gen functions ([#1500](https://github.com/unjs/nitro/pull/1500)).

While the default target remains v1, we highly recommend migrating by setting the `firebase.gen: 2` config ([Learn More](https://nitro.unjs.io/deploy/providers/firebase#using-2nd-generation-firebase-functions)).

## üîì Upgrade to 2.6

When upgrading, make sure to renew your project's package manager lockfile and `node_modules` dir to avoid hosting issues.
