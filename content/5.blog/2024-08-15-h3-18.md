> H3 is a universal HTTP framework written in Typescript powering [Nitro](https://nitro.unjs.io/) and [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com/).

H3 was born almost two years ago with [the first commit](https://github.com/unjs/h3/tree/cbc8909b2003d6d5df694ab7a36aa067cc990c74) and the goal of making the simplest possible HTTP framework for [Nuxt 3](https://nuxt.com/) with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) compatibility, Elegant developer experience, and a futuristic vision to be compatible with Edge and Worker runtimes out of the box which back in the time was so new.

At the same time, we have developed [unjs/unenv](https://github.com/unjs/unenv/tree/main) a thin layer to unblock Node.js libraries and http middleware for Edge compatible runtimes without Node.js. This was crucial to make sure we can leverage most of the NPM and Node.js ecosystem to develop applications without making everything from scratch. H3 and Unenv together made [Nitro](https://nitro.unjs.io) one of the first web frameworks that is fully compatible with Edge runtimes.

We have worked hard to bring you native Web API compatibility exprience with h3 out of the box.

### Web and Plain Adapters

We have introduced a new built-in adapter for [fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) compatible web handler with [Request](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Request) input and [Response](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response) return value.

This means that you can directly run your H3 applications out of the box on Cloudflare Workers, Deno Deploy, Bun.sh and Lagon.

Checkout [h3-on-edge](https://github.com/pi0/h3-on-edge) repository for examples and [demo](https://h3-on-edge.deno.dev/).

```ts
// import { createApp, eventHandler, toWebHandler } from 'h3'
import { createApp, eventHandler, toWebHandler } from 'https://esm.sh/h3@1.8.0'

const app = createApp()

app.use(
  '/',
  eventHandler(event => 'H3 works on edge!'),
)
const webHandler = toWebHandler(app) // (Request) => Promise<Response>
```

In addition to web handlers, we have introduced a new plain adapter format with `toPlainHandler(app)` syntax. This allows to virtually integrate H3 with any serverless platform with plain input and response objects!

All of this is possible using new streaming capabilities and [unjs/unenv](https://unenv.unjs.io) that brings super lightweight Node.js compatibilities. Before, this was only possible with [Nitro presets](https://nitro.unjs.io/deploy).

Additionally we have introduced new web helpers:

- `toWebRequest`: Conver a H3 event object to web [Request](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Request)
- `getRequestWebStream`: Get a readable stream from the current H3 event request.
- `fromPlainHandler`: Convert a plain object handler into H3 compatible event handler
- `fromWebHandler`: Convert a Web Request/Response handler into H3 compatible event handler

### Web Streams Support

H3 now supports native [Readable Stream](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ReadableStream) responses. This brings out of the box compatibility with modern new libraries such as [Vercel/AI](https://github.com/vercel/ai) Streaming Support ([demo](https://github.com/Hebilicious/nuxt-openai-vercel-edge-demo)).

In order to leverage this functionality, you can simply return a [Readable Stream](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ReadableStream) or [Response](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response) object from your event handlers!

```ts
export default defineEventHandler((event) => {
  setResponseHeader(event, 'Content-Type', 'text/html')
  const encoder = new TextEncoder()
  const stream = new ReadableStream({
    async start(controller) {
      for (const token of 'Straming is so cool with H3!'.split(' ')) {
        controller.enqueue(encoder.encode(token))
        await new Promise((resolve) => {
          setTimeout(resolve, 300)
        })
      }
    },
  })
  return stream
})
```

For advanced usecases, you might also use `sendStream` and `sendWebResponse` utilities instead of returning stream.

### Object Syntax Event Handlers

H3 supports a new way to define event handlers with Object syntax. Using object syntax you can define hooks that run before or after each handler such authentication or compression middleware.

```ts
const auth = defineRequestMiddleware((event) => {
  event.context.auth = { name: 'admin' }
})

const compression = defineResponseMiddleware((event) => {
  // Checkout this example: https://stackblitz.com/edit/github-mb6bz3
})

export default eventHandler({
  onRequest: [auth],
  beforeResponse: [compression],
  async handler(event) {
    return `Hello ${event.context.auth?.name || 'Guest'}`
  },
})
```

### Typed Event Handler Requests

You can now define H3 event types using new generic support.

All compasable utilities will be aware of the types. This also unblocks us to improve types `$fetch` handlers in upstream frameworks.

```ts
export default eventHandler<{ body: { name: string }; query: { id: string } }>(
  (event) => {
    const query = getQuery(event) // Query is typed as { id: string }
    const body = await readBody(event) // Body is typed as { name: string }
  },
)
```

### Runtime + Type-safe Request Utils

Two new `getValidatedQuery(event, validator)` and `readValidatedBody(event, validator)` utils, allow integration with schema validators such as [zod](https://zod.dev/) for both runtime and type safety.

```ts
const userSchema = z.object({
  name: z.string().default('Guest'),
  email: z.email().required(),
})

export default defineEventHandler((event) => {
  const user = await readValidatedBody(event, userSchema.parse)
  // User object is validated and typed!
  return {
    user
  }
})
```

## New Utils

We have introduced couple of more composable utils to make web app development experience easier:

- `clearResponseHeaders`: Clear all (current) response headers
- `removeResponseHeader`: Remove a specific response header
- `getRequestIP`: Get the incoming request IP. `X-Forwarded-For` can be optionally enabled
- `readFormData`: Read request body into [FormData](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FormData)
- `serveStatic`: Platform agnostic static asset serve. Checkout [listhen source](https://github.com/unjs/listhen/blob/af6ea3af3fec4289c00b0ba589ca6f63c6a5dbbd/src/server/dev.ts#L66) for an example usage with Node.js.
