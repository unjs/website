## About UnJS

UnJS, pronounced `/ʌn-dʒeɪɛs/` or `un-jay-ess`, is a collection, an ecosystem, of JavaScript libraries, tools and utilities to elevate the coding journey of developers.

UnJS is a short form of **Unified JavaScript**, which refers to the idea that every package can work both together and individually, with external packages, in any environment and agnostic of any framework or library, to reunify the JavaScript ecosystem around a common vision.

Please write **UnJS** and not **unJS** or **Unjs** or **unjs**.

However, all packages are lowercase, like `unbuild`, `ofetch`, `nitro`, etc.

## Logo

The UnJS logo is a combination of these two elements:

- Two letters, `u` and `u`, the Un part of UnJS, but lowercase on the logo
- The logo of JavaScript with the iconic yellow color, the JS part of UnJS

Note that the logo, like repos, is lowercase.

The logo can be used on a white background or a black background.

## Colors

UnJS colors are based on the JavaScript logo colors with a yellow color as the main color and a deep black as the secondary color to create contrast inside the logo.

## Typography

UnJS uses the [Nunito](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Nunito) font for its rounded and friendly look. This reminds us of the ambition of unifying the JavaScript ecosystem around a common vision and the agnostic nature of UnJS.
