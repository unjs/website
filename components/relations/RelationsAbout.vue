      Welcome to UnJS Relations, a tool to help you visualize the interdependencies between packages in the <strong>
        UnJS
      </strong> ecosystem and with other npm packages.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>
        UnJS
      </strong> is a large and <strong>complex ecosystem</strong>. It's not easy to get to grips with, to understand and can be very intimidating, especially for beginners.
    </p>
    <p>
      Despite this, it's very <strong>powerful</strong>, with packages that can be integrated into all your projects. Understanding and visualizing the links between the different packages could help you to <strong>better understand</strong> how the ecosystem is composed and articulated.
    </p>
    <p>
      To start using the tool, you can click on <em>UnJS Packages</em> or <em>npm Packages</em> in the menu to selection the packages you want to visualize. You can also use the settings to show or hide dependencies, devDependencies and children (packages using selected packages).
    </p>
